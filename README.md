# Proximity Grab for Virt-A-Mate

**Proximity Grab** allows you to grab and attach objects using a configurable proximity sphere. It uses physics-based joints for smooth, natural movement.

🔗 **[Virt-A-Mate Hub Link](https://hub.virtamate.com/resources/)** (Pending)

## Features
*   **Proximity Detection**: Uses a sphere overlap to find targets near your hand. No aiming required!
*   **Visual Feedback**: Draws a green wireframe sphere to show exactly what is in range.
*   **Smart Parenting**: Intelligently ignores the parent object if attached to a hand (so you don't grab your own chest).
*   **Physics Presets**: Choose between Soft, Firm, or Locked joints.
*   **Adjustable Offsets**: Fine-tune the grab position relative to the controller.

## Installation
1.  Download the `ProximityGrab.var` package (or scripts).
2.  Place in your `AddonPackages` (or `Custom/Scripts`) folder.
3.  Select a Controller (e.g., Right Hand).
4.  Add Plugin -> Select `ProximityGrab.cs`.
